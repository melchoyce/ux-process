##Building a Successful UX Process
==========

Design is, fundamentally, about problem solving. Our clients often come to us with solutions, but do these solutions even solve the right problems? Whether you’re using WordPress to build enterprise-level websites or web apps for startups, a strong UX research and discovery phase can help bring any confused project into perspective, create focus, and set the path for an accurate solution (and a happy client).
